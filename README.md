Hi, I'm Steve. I like drinking coffee and making software.

I most frequently program in C#, JavaScript, C++, and Python (sometimes Java).

Most of my open-source contributions revolve around .NET. My code is in .NET 6 and above. See the [contributors list](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/thanks/6.0).

I made the CA1861 analyzer. If you have any issues, please feel free to mention me in them.
