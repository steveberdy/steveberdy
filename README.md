Hi, I'm Steve. I like drinking coffee and <s>breaking</s> making software.

I most frequently program in C#, JavaScript, C++ and Python. If you force me to, I can also write in Java.

My code is in .NET 6 and above! See the [contributors list](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/thanks/6.0).

I made the CA1861 analyzer. If you have any issues, please feel free to yell at me about the analyzer.
